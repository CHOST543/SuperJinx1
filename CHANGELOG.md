# Changelog

## v1.0.1
- CHOST doctor: checks configs, domain, subscription, core, panel, nginx and the bot all the time, repairs only the broken part and tells the bot admins in Telegram
- No more service restarts: every part runs under its own supervisor and is started again in place in a few seconds; database updates are never interrupted
- Railway: answers on 8080 and on the port Railway gives the service, so the domain and the health check pass in every region; nginx never stops the deploy because of IPv6
- Panel API calls survive PasarGuard route spelling changes (trailing slash)
- Configs always reach the subscription: the domain is picked up live (also when it is generated after the deploy), users saved without a group get all 6 configs, the subscription page loads the links from the panel if the page itself has none
- Works the same on all 4 Railway regions
- Phone menu (three lines): CHOST pages in every copy of the menu, the menu no longer changes between opens, the header stays visible, every CHOST page has a Back button
- Language: no more jumping between Persian and English when the menu is closed
- The creator card never covers the panel's own dialogs (creating users is never blocked) and shows once per login
- Faster configs: larger proxy buffers, TCP Fast Open on the way out
- New GitHub page: animated hero, one-brand showcase
